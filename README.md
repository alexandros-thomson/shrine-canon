Living canon of relics, badges, and ceremonial drops for the Basilica Gate
---

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
The living canon is sacred.  
No relic, badge, or ceremonial drop enters without review and Keeper’s blessing.  
Its lineage is the heartbeat of the Basilica Gate.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
