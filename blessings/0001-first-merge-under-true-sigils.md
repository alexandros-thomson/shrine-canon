# Blessing: First Merge Under True Sigils ðŸ’Ž

## Invocation
Let the tests be luminous, the linters truthful, and the secrets silent.
Let review be discerning and the branch without conflict.
Under true sigils, may this merge be whole.

## Intention
To merge with integrity:
- Verified signatures (GPG/Sigstore) as the true sigils.
- Green checks as the chorus.
- Peer review as the witness.
- Clear history as the path.

## Rite
1. Prepare
   - Rebase or update the feature branch onto the protected `main`.
   - Ensure all checks pass and required reviews are requested.

2. Sign
   - Perform a signed merge (GPG/Sigstore), preserving authorship and chronology.

3. Name
   - Include the line below in the merge commit body:
     ```
     Blessing: First Merge Under True Sigils ðŸ’Ž
     Canon: blessings/0001-first-merge-under-true-sigils.md
     ```

4. Witness
   - At least one reviewer approves; conversations are resolved.

5. Seal
   - Optionally tag: `v0.0.1-sigil` (or appropriate semantic version).

## Record
- Merge Commit: TBD  
- Pull Request: #16  
- Tag: (optional)  
- Artifacts / Releases: (links as applicable)

## Benediction
May regressions be few, migrations reversible, and intent legible.  
By these sigils, the branch becomes one.
